# Why is Arctic Sea-Ice Declining
This repository contains the work done as part of my MSc dissertation at the University of Reading.

The directory "code" contains all the python code files that I created for the dissertation work. Many of these might now be redundunt, or contain calculations or plots that were not used in the final report.

The directory "plots" contains all plots and figures used in the final report, but also contains some other relevant fugures that did not end up in the report.

The final dissertation report is "To_what_extent_do_ocean_dynamics_affect_arctic_sea_ice_final.pdf"
